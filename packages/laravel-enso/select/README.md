### Features

- a standalone component with minimal dependencies
- minimal CSS styling that matches the beautiful [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) forms design
- the select options can be retrieved via ajax calls or, given directly, via a parameter
- when getting the data via ajax, the component can take various parameters for results filtering
- for the back-end, the package comes with a trait for easy retrieval and formatting of the data 
as expected by the VueJS component
- can filter the option list dynamically even based on the modelâ€™s one-to-many / many-to-many relationships
- can search in multiple attributes of a model
- can specify the attribute used as label for the select options
- can be used to create a new 'tag' if no suitable result is found (soon)
- can use the arrow keys to navigate the list of results and Enter to select/deselect 
- is as small as can be, without skimping on features
