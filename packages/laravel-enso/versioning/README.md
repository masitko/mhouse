Prevents update conflicts using the optimistic lock pattern in Laravel

### Details

- the package creates a `versionings` table where it holds versions for all the versionable models
- by using the `Versionable` trait on a model versioning is handled automatically
- by default the trait appends a `version` attribute after the model is retrieved used for tracking versions and expects the same attribute to be present on the model when the update is called
- the default versioning attribute can be customized by using `protected $versioningAttribute = 'customVersionAttribte'` on the model
- the trait can be used on models that already have records in the database, the versioning starts with the first retrieval of those models
- when a versionable model is deleted its versioning is deleted also. If the model uses `SoftDeletes` the versioning is deleted only on model `forceDelete`
- throws a `ConflictHttpException` if the version is incorrect
- tests are included with the package
- package comes included by default with [Enso](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso)
