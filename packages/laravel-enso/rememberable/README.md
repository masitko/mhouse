Model caching for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

### Details

- comes with 2 traits that provide helper methods for quick and easy caching usage (setting and retrieving)
- the cache lifetime may be set per model, else, if not set, the per-project setting is used, finally falling back to a default of 60 minutes if neither option is available
- uses the Laravel `cache()` helper method so is transparent to the cache mechanism/implementation
